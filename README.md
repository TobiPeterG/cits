# Contributor in the Spotlight

## What it is

- highlight a contributor and they highlight their work
- different domain every month (e.g. art, coding)
- make community familiar with what contributors do

## Why we do it

- a lot of work contributors do is "invisible"
- provide easy way for people to show their work
- thank contributors for their work
- highlight areas where people can contribute

## How it works

- what you do:
  - create a [new issue](https://github.com/TobiPeterG/cits/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=application-contributor-in-the-spotlight.md&title=%5BAPPLICATION%5D)
  - fill out the template
  - select the label for the month you are applying for
  - done :)
- what we do:
  - go through all applications for the current month
  - select one application and prepare a blog post
  - create a blog post on [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org) on first monday of every month, 4PM UTC

## Guidelines

- you want to show what you have been working on? --> apply
- applications need to be:
  - handed in until 15th of the month
  - written in English
  - about yourself, not someone else
- applications need to contain:
  - brief introduction of you
  - description/use cases of the contribution
  - picture of you OR a short video or image showcasing contribution
  - URL to the project OR proof of contribution
  - how does it relate to openSUSE?
  - what is special about it?
